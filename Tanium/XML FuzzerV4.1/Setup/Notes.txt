* Patch Client(TaniumClient) Application to run the SOAP server without the Tanium Server Connected:
	Functions:
	sub_432900 proc near - Server Port
	sub_4342C0 proc near - (-c)
	loc_440F67: - ClientSOAPPort
	loc_440F35: - 127.0.0.1
	loc_6DA130 - Start ClientSOAP pump




	_main -> sub_444470 -> sub_43EB90 -> sub_6D9690 -> Start ClientSOAP pump


* Command line args = -c, -m


Side Note:
Very Interesting Function in TaniumServer(TaniumReciever)
sub_140237A70 proc near = SOAP/Server Init


New Plan:

* Fuzz the Tanium Server (TaniumReceiver)

Process:
	1. Start the Tanium Server Service
	2. Attach the TaniumReciever.exe with pykd
	3. Send malformed XML (POST) to the Tanium Server (radamsa)
	4. Catch the crash
		* Get register data
		* Load !exploitable
		* Log crash data output and poc.xml
	5. Restart the TaniumReciever.exe
	6. Wait 30 seconds for Server to come back online
	7. Re-run the fuzzer

Fuzzing Setup:

1. Tanium Server VM
2. Fuzzer with malformed XML testcases sent over the wire to the Tanium Server
3. Harness that detects crashes and loads !exploitable when access violation occurs
4. Status_Checker that checks if server is online/offline
